## 📊 Project Workflow

### ✅ 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies
- Standardized column names and converted data types
- Saved cleaned dataset for further analysis

### 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized relationships between customer features and churn
- Analyzed categorical and numerical distributions
- Identified key churn drivers

### 👥 3. Customer Segmentation
- Grouped customers based on behavioral patterns and service usage
- Applied clustering techniques to identify distinct customer types

### 🤖 4. Churn Prediction Modeling
- Implemented and evaluated models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### 💡 5. Retention Strategies
- Suggested action plans based on churn drivers
- Identified loyal customer profiles
- Recommended strategies to retain at-risk customers
